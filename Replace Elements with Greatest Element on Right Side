Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]

1. Approach:
A naive method is to run two loops. The outer loop will one by one pick array elements from left to right. 
The inner loop will find the greatest element present after the picked element.
Finally the outer loop will replace the picked element with the greatest element found by inner loop. The time complexity of this method will be O(n*n).

2. Optimise approach --> T(C)-O(n)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> replaceElements(vector<int>& arr) {
        int maxi=-1;
        for(int i=arr.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
            int temp=maxi;
            
                if(arr[i] > maxi)
                    maxi = arr[i];
            
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
        return arr;
    }
};
